# QuizApp2
The Quiz App is meant to test basic Project Management Knowledge.
In designing the app, I had to take into consideration, and use the following views to achieve it:
TextView, EditText, RadioGroup, RadioButtons, ScrollView and Buttons.
While positioning my views, I used LinearLayout with both horizontal and vertical orientations appropriately.
In the MainActivity.Java file, I created the following methods:
displayTotalScore - to use Toast to display total score with candidate's name.
scoreSummary - to return the scores of single choice and multichoice questions as an int
firstOne - to get the keywords from the EditText of first question and return the score as an int
checkAnswer - to listen for the right single choice and add the corresponding score
